# FRANC
Franc is an ERC-20 token with a 100 trillion token limit. This is hard-coded.

None of this is financial advice, and cryptocurrencies are prone to volatility. Collect wisely.
I do not represent ANY organization mentioned other than being the creator of the Franc token.
Cryptocurrencies are seen as the currency of the future, with encryption and digital presence being most valued.
The fluctuations in price can result in a loss of a lot of assets.
However, holding (sometimes called HODLing) crypto assets have proven to be a possible way to greatly increase wealth in a short amount of time.
By buying and later selling when the price is high, collectors have made millions, some billions, of dollars in just months or less.
AGAIN: This is not financial advice. Like any collection, collect at your own risk.
If you merely would like to buy or swap for some Franc to collect (like a coin or token collector), then please do.
No gain of wealth is guaranteed and loss is possible in all collections.
Please proceed with caution.

To buy, swap, and collect Franc, a user must create an Ethereum ERC-20 compatible wallet.
ERC-20 wallets include Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask. (As of July 18, 2021)

Instructions on one way to get started:
Recommended: Download and install Google Chrome.
Go to the Coinbase website and create an account.
Deposit money from your bank account into your Coinbase account.
Find your Coinbase Wallet Ethereum address. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE COINBASE Ethereum address.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
At the time of this writing (July 18, 2021), Coinbase Wallet supports ANY ERC-20 token, but please read the information on their site.
Specifics may change. To be clear, the Coinbase Ethereum address for receiving is not the same as the Coinbase Wallet Ethereum address for receiving.
Coinbase Wallet supports unlisted ERC-20 tokens, Coinbase (Not Coinbase Wallet) only supports ERC-20 which it lists (Please consult Coinbase site).
As of the time of this writing (July 18, 2021), if you transfer unlisted ERC-20 tokens, or any cryptocurrency not supported by Coinbase, to a Coinbase Ethereum wallet, YOUR ASSET WILL BE LOST!
Only send unsupported ERC-20 tokens to the Coinbase Wallet Ethereum account address.

Back to instructions.
1) Create Coinbase account
2) Deposit money from your bank account into your Coinbase account
3) Buy Ethereum (ETH, NOT Ethereum Classic, known as ETC) or an ERC-20 compatible token
4) Download the Coinbase Wallet app, such as on iOS or Android
5) Note: Each time you transfer money from one address to another, you lose a little because you must pay a transaction and miner fee, called a "Gas Fee"
6) SEND that cryptocurrency (You now own cryptocurrency, yay!) to your Coinbase Wallet Ethereum Address (click receive in the Wallet app to see address)
7) Go to the MetaMask website and create an account and add the extension to Google Chrome
8) Send your cryptocurrency from your Coinbase Wallet account to you MetaMask account
9) Go to the Uniswap website and click on connect wallet and then MetaMask
10) You could have done this with Coinbase Wallet, but MetaMask may be better for this part and get you better gas fees from my experience
11) Send your cryptocurrency from your Coinbase Wallet account to your MetaMask account
12) Select your currency you will use to swap with, such as Ethereum, then select Franc as the token to get from the swap
13) Franc may not be listed automatically, and so you may have to enter the Contract address: 0xbabd6aa0798b805309533601ef4459103803e09b
14) Click on swap and follow the instructions and agree. Notice there is a gas fee, which may increase or decrease, depending on the time or day
15) Once this goes through, you will own some Franc. Remember, DO NOT TRANSFER THIS TO YOUR COINBASE ETHEREUM ADDRESS
16) You may transfer it to your Coinbase Wallet Ethereum address if you'd like for safe keeping, or transfer only some
17) You can now fully trade Franc, or just keep it for the sake of collecting coins/tokens.
18) Voil√†!
